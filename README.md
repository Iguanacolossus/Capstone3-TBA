## 1. **Forcasting comparing ARIMA to RNN:**



## 2. **Anomoly detection with clustering techniques:**



## **3 classification of sequencial data with RNN:** 
>## Identifying seizures form wrist mounted accelerometers.

>- The data was generated with healthy participants simulating the class activities of performed. Data was collected from 6 participants using a tri-axial accelerometer on the dominant wrist whilst conducting 4 different activities: walking, running, sawing, and mimicing seizure. 

**motivation:** Having an app on your smart watch that could alert your family or 911 if you are having a seizure could help with anxiety of epileptic people and possible be life saving if person is in a dangerous situation. (I also want to try my hand at sequentioal data that is not NLP)

**my worries**: each sample/series consists of three channels (acceleraomiter directions in space). I have been doing alot or reading and still have not been able to figure out how i would encode this to have one sequence for each sample. the rnn examples in my books are either for sentiment  prediction with NLP or time series forcasting with one 'channel'. and i did read some scientific journals about 'human activity recognition' and they either dont go into detail about exactly how they encode the chanels to be one sample for the rnn or i found one that uses CNN and treats samples as like 3 dementional images (so maybe this is too advanced for 1.5 weeks?)
