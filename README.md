# **Identifing Seizures From Wrist Mounted Sensors**
<!--
## **1. Forcasting with ARIMA or RNN and prediction with linear regression:**
> ## forcasting short term solar generation from plant in india for better grid managment.

>This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one weather sensor readings dataset. <br>

**my idea:** I am thinking that first i would make a regression model that takes in the weather sensor data and predicts the power generationfrom the plant. then I would forcast the weather data for 48 hours , then use that with my regression model to predict the energy generation for then next two days

>- The data was generated with healthy participants simulating the class activities of performed. Data was collected from 6 participants using a tri-axial accelerometer on the dominant wrist whilst conducting 4 different activities: walking, running, sawing, and mimicing seizure. 


## MVP:
create model to cluster accelerometr data into the k movement groups. 

## Other things:
use a neural network to classify seizure not seizure movements.

## 2. **unsupervised learning:**
> ### demension reduction and clustering of sensor measurments from water treatment plant to find operational state of plant. (maybe anomoly detection?)
